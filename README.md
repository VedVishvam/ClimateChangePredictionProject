# Explanation
So what this climate change prediction system does is it predicts the change of weather in that month. So it will predict the future weather change. 

How the model works is it uses historical data to predict the future average temperature change. It finds the best line of fit and the pattern in the data and uses those to factors to predict.

So how this system works is you feed your dataset which is split into a training dataset and a testing dataset, because if you just use one you can’t full train it. 

So if later on we want to use a more improved dataset we can, and if we didn’t train it with a split dataset it won’t produce good accuracy. 

So we have to train the model to be accurate, so first we feed the training dataset set which contains 80% of the main dataset. Then you have to test the model with the testing dataset. So know you can see the real accuracy because the model wasn’t trained with this so this is completely new for it.
