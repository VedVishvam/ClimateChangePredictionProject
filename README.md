# Explanation
This climate change prediction system forecasts future weather.  It uses historical data to predict future weather, by analyzing trends and patterns in the historical dataset. 

The process involves by splitting the data into a training set and a testing set by doing this essential process it ensures that the model will have good accuracy when using new and improved data.

After splitting the datasets, the model analyzes trends and patterns and creates a best line of fit. Using this best line of fit it can predict the future weather. 

Keep in mind that future weather is not solely based on historical weather patterns and trends, instead it is based on multiple factors that affect the future weather.
