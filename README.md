This linear regression model is not 100% accurate use at your own risk.

This model works by first feeding it with training dataset to train the model and then feeding it with a testing dataset to test the models accuracy after training it. Then feeding it with a validation dataset to validate the models accuracy.

The Dataset is from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Sciences and Exploration.
